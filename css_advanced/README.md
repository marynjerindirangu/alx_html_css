# CSS Advanced

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum**. The goal is to implement a webpage from a Figma design file.

For this phase, the focus is on **HTML structure only**:

- No CSS or styling yet
- Semantic and valid HTML
- Preparing the structure for the next step: CSS Advanced

## Files

- `index.html` → main HTML file for the webpage
- `styles.css` → stylesheet to be added in the next stage
- `README.md` → this file, explaining the project

## Resources

- [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/) _(requires a free account to view)_
- Fonts: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and **Spin Cycle OT**

## Notes

- Only semantic HTML was used for structure
- CSS styling will be implemented in the next phase of the project
